#In a survey of 500 voters from neighbourhood A and 300 from
#neighbourhood B, a candidate was preferred by 43 % of those in A and
#42 % of those in B. At the α = 5 % level.
#Find confidence intervals for the expected results in A and B.
# For A:
pA <- 43 / 100
nA <- 500
e <- qnorm (.975) * sqrt ( pA * (1 - pA ) / nA )
c( pA - e , pA + e )
# For B:
pB <- 42 / 100
nB <- 300
e <- qnorm (.975) * sqrt ( pB * (1 - pB ) / nB )
c( pB - e , pB + e )
